## Validate the ns-3 implementation of TCP Veno using ns-3 DCE
## Course Code: CO365

## Assignment: #14

### Overview
TCP Veno is also targeted to improve the performance of TCP in wireless
environments. It is a combination of Vegas and Reno, and hence, named Veno. In this
project, the aim is to validate ns-3 TCP Veno implementation by comparing the results
obtained from it to those obtained by simulating Linux TCP Veno.
